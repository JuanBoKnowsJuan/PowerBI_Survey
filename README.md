# PowerBI_Survey
This is a PowerBI project

This project collected real-time survey data from LinkedIn, focusing on individuals in roles such as Data Analysts or Data Scientists. 
Its aim was to gauge the level of difficulty in entering the data field. Additionally, I conducted an analysis on the programming languages 
commonly used by these professionals, their geographical distribution, and average salaries. This dataset offers further opportunities for exploration.

# Skills used
I refined the data to enhance its usability, although there's still room for further improvement. My process involved employing conditional formatting, 
establishing bins, establishing relationships, utilizing Power Query, implementing drill-downs, and applying DAX calculation.
